            <h3>José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              was a Filipino nationalist, writer and polymath active at the end of the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines. He is considered a national hero (pambansang bayani) of the Philippines.
            </p>
            <p>
              He was executed by the Spanish colonial government for the crime of rebellion after the Philippine Revolution broke out; it was inspired by his writings. 
              Though he was not actively involved in its planning or conduct, he ultimately approved of its goals which eventually resulted in Philippine independence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rizal is widely considered one of the greatest heroes of the Philippines and has been recommended to be so honored by an officially empaneled National Heroes Committee. However, no law, executive order or proclamation has been enacted or issued officially proclaiming any Filipino historical figure as a national hero.
               He wrote the novels Noli Me Tángere (1887) and El filibusterismo (1891), which together are taken as a national epic, in addition to numerous poems and essays.

                <h3>Noli Me Tángere</h3>
                <p class="fst-italic">Its title is derived from Latin which means " don't turn (or touch) me ". This is quoted from John 20:17 where Jesus said to Mary Magdalene "Do not accuse me because I have not yet ascended to my father."</p>
                <img src="assets/img/work1.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>Rizal's first novel is Noli me Tangere . It was published when he was 26 years old. This book is historical and became an instrument for Filipinos to build a national identity. 
                  In an indirect way, Rizal's book influenced the revolution but Rizal himself was a believer in a peaceful action and a direct representation of the Spanish government. It was originally written in Spanish, the language of the educated at that time.
                  <br><br>Originally written by Rizal in Spanish, the book has since been more commonly published and read in the Philippines in either Tagalog (the major indigenous language), or English. The Rizal Law requires Noli and its sequel, El filibusterismo, to be read by all high school students throughout the country. Noli is studied in Grade 9 and El filibusterismo in Grade 10. The two novels are widely considered to be the national epic of the Philippines. 
                  They have been adapted in many forms, such as operas, musicals, plays, and other forms of art.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="tab-pane" id="tab-2">
                <h3>El Filibusterismo</h3>
                <p class="fst-italic">It is the sequel to Noli Me Tángere and, like the first book, was written in Spanish. It was first published in 1891 in Ghent.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/work2.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>The novel centers on the Noli-El fili duology's main character Crisóstomo Ibarra, now returning for vengeance as "Simoun". 
                  The novel's dark theme departs dramatically from the previous novel's hopeful and romantic atmosphere, signifying Ibarra's resort to solving his country's issues through violent means, after his previous attempt in reforming the country's system made no effect and seemed impossible with the corrupt attitude of the Spaniards toward the Filipinos.<br><br>
                  The novel, along with its predecessor, was banned in some parts of the Philippines as a result of their portrayals of the Spanish government's abuses and corruption. These novels, along with Rizal's involvement in organizations that aimed to address and reform the Spanish system and its issues, led to Rizal's exile to Dapitan and eventual execution. 
                  Both the novel and its predecessor, along with Rizal's last poem, are now considered Rizal's literary masterpieces.</p>

                <h3>Junto al Pasig</h3>
                <p class="fst-italic">The story revolves around Christianity, Good vs Evil and Paganism. It ended on how Leonido praised the Virgin Mary on saving him.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/work3.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>Since  the  day  we  existed  in  this  world,  there’s  a  lot  of  temptations.  A  fight  between  good  and bad. A story  about  a  man  who  protected  his  faith  through  series  of  temptations.  A  story  entitled Junto Al Pasigwhich means “Along the Pasig River”written by Dr. Jose P. Rizal. <br><br>The story revolves in the coming of the feast of the Virgin Mary. 
                  The havoc of Satan to the world of humans to tempt them to change and worship him.This is also the time where the pilipinos are under the colonialism of the Spanish.A story written to show the love for the country and all of its sufferings under its conquerors specially the Spaniards</p>

                <h3>To the Young Women of Malolos</h3>
                <p class="fst-italic"> To awaken and prepare the mind of the child for every good and desirable idea; And to teach children to prefer death with honor to life with dishonor.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/work4.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>In February 1889, Rizal wrote a letter to the young women of Malolos in response to their petition to Governor-General Weyler to open a night school for women. Rizal expressed his delight and admiration toward these women, correcting himself for believing that Filipino women are meek, and commending them for their unwavering determination to seek education. 
                  He understood that an educated woman can have a far-reaching impact on her family, community, and ultimately the entire nation. <br> <br>In this letter, Rizal highlighted the profound significance placed on the contributions of women and acknowledged their essential role in shaping a progressive and enlightened nation. He recognized that the progress and advancement of any society are intricately tied to the education and empowerment of its women. 
                  Rizal's letter emphasizes the transformative potential of education for women, empowering them to become active participants in social, economic, and political spheres.</p>

                <h3>The Diaries of José Rizal</h3>
                <p class="fst-italic">Rizal’s 1884 diary can be used as a tool to obtain more insight about Rizal’s life during his 20s and his personality towards school, his parents, and colleagues.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/work5.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>Citing the book, Habana said Rizal had a typical boyhood except for the fact that he was not born a very “cute baby,” especially with his “very big head abnormally large for his body,” which made Rizal barely able to walk at two years old. <br><br>
                  But Rizal showed his prodigy even at a young age, starting at nine years old when he studied in his aunt’s house at Binyang where was taught by a stern tutor Rizal described as a “tall, thin, long-necked man, with a sharp nose and a body bent slightly forward” who gave him beatings or lashed him despite his stellar performance in school.</p>

              <div class="tab-pane" id="tab-6">
                <h3>El Canto Del Viajero</h3>
                <p class="fst-italic">Song of the Wanderer is a poem that talks about Jose Rizalhimself as a wanderer or traveler.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/work6.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>The Song of the Traveller is a poem that reflects Rizal's own experiences as a wanderer or traveler. It describes the loneliness and heartbreak of being away from his homeland for a long time and feeling like a stranger in his own country upon his return.<br><br> This poem speaks of Rizal's homesickness despite his enjoyment of freedom in abroad. 
                  Rizal is talking about the life of a traveler, that being a traveler encounters a lot of obstacles (the ups and downs of our life), but it is not just about travelling it's about on how we manage the obstacle in our life.</p>

                <p>This poem expresses the speaker's grief and resignation upon parting from his beloved, Leonor. The speaker uses repetition to emphasize the finality of their separation and the pain it causes. The poem's simple language and straightforward structure convey the speaker's intense emotions without resorting to excessive ornamentation. <br><br>
                  Compared to Rizal's other works, this poem stands out for its brevity and directness. While many of his other poems explore complex themes of patriotism and social justice, "Goodbye to Leonor" focuses on the deeply personal experience of loss. The poem echoes the themes of romantic love and heartbreak common in the Romantic era during which it was written.</p>

                <h3>Mi Ultimo Adios</h3>
                <p class="fst-italic">"Mi Ultimo Adios" by Jose Rizal is a poem that can be classified as both a sonnet and an elegy.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/work8.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>A poem written by Filipino propagandist and writer Dr. José Rizal before his execution by firing squad on December 30, 1896. The piece was one of the last notes he wrote before his death. Another that he had written was found in his shoe, but because the text was illegible, its contents remain a mystery.<br><br> 
                  Rizal did not ascribe a title to his poem. Mariano Ponce, his friend and fellow reformist, titled it "Mi último pensamiento" ("My Last Thought") in the copies he distributed, but this did not catch on. Also, the "coconut oil lamp" containing the poem was not delivered to the Rizal's family until after the execution as it was required to light the cell.</p>
